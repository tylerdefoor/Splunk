# Splunk

This is a repository that currently has my scripts for installing Splunk in a semi-automated fashion. Doing this through an actual automation/containerization technology is more ideal.

A word of warning - don't just take these if you don't understand what they do. Knowing how to modify these is integral to setting up Splunk. These just run through some commands that are run on most every Splunk instance of its type. You must know the OS you are installing on, which conf files these write to, how the pieces interact, how things change in a site aware environment, etc.
